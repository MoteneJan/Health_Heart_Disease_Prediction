# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data. The notebook walks through all the typical data science phases including loading the dataset, exploration, cleaning, model training, and evaluation.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset (`Heart_Disease_Dataset.csv`) contains various features such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression
- Target (1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence)

## ðŸš€ Project Structure


## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning

The project trains one or more classification models (K Neighbors Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier) to predict heart disease. It includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training
- Accuracy evaluation

## ðŸ’» Running the Notebook

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```
3. Open the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb
    ```

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Make sure you have `Heart_Disease_Dataset.csv` in the same directory as the notebook.
- Annotated notebook is provided for educational purposes.
